The respository contains information and code relating to the Schistosoma mansoni genome project 
from Matt Berriman's Parasite Genomics group (Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Glasgow), 
and supporting information to the manuscript entitled "Assembled chromosomes of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni provide 
insight into the evolution of its ZW sex-determination system".

The manuscript is currently available on bioRxiv [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.456314) and 
is currently under peer review.

Abstract:
*Background*
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes a neglected tropical disease affecting hundreds 
of millions worldwide. Most flatworms are hermaphrodites but schistosomes have genotypically determined 
male (ZZ) and female (ZW) sexes. Sex is essential for pathology and transmission, however, the molecular 
determinants that drive sex-specific developmental programmes remain unknown and are limited by poorly 
resolved sex chromosomes in previous genome assemblies.

*Results* 
Here we present a 391.4 Mb S. mansoni genome assembly resolved into seven single-scaffold autosomes with both Z and W sex chromosomes separately defined. Annotation of this assembly incorporating short and long-read RNAseq data together with manual curation allowed us to resolve gene and repeat arrays, trans-splicing, and UTRs, resulting in vastly improved gene models. The sex chromosomes each comprise pseudoautosomal- and sex-specific regions; the Z-specific region contains 932 genes, of which only 33 gametologues have been retained in the W-specific region, and five of these have become pseudogenes indicating that degeneration of W is ongoing. Comparative analysis between closely related Schistosoma spp. reveals an ancient chromosomal fusion within a shared ancestrally sex-specific region of Z; here, only a single protein-coding gene—encoding the large subunit of pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF—has retained an intact copy on W. The sex-specific copies of U2AF have divergent N-termini and show sex-biased gene expression.

*Conclusion*
Our chromosomally-resolved assembly and curated annotation is a significant improvement on existing genetic resources for S. mansoni, an important but neglected human pathogen. Delineation of the Z and W chromosomes, together with identifying a single sex-linked gene that shows genetic and transcriptomic differences between sexes, is a major advance toward resolving the evolutionary path taken to establish two distinct sexes in schistosomes.
